# Cipherschool-summer-projects



- C++ Mini Projects



# Project Description
This repository contains three mini-projects developed in C++ as part of a 1.5-month online training program with CipherSchools. The projects demonstrate various aspects of C++ programming, including game development, task management, and social media simulation. Each project is designed to enhance understanding and application of core C++ concepts.

# Projects Overview
1. Guess Number Game
2. TO-DO List Manager
3. Social Media Program

Project 1: Guess Number Game
A simple number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

> Features:
* Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
* Provides feedback to the player whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
* Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.

Project 2: TO-DO List Manager
A console-based task management system to help users keep track of their tasks.

> Features:
* Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
* Filter tasks by categories.
* Undo the last deleted task.
* Display task progress (completed vs. total tasks).
* Create custom categories.

Project 3: Social Media Program
A simple simulation of a social media platform where users can add friends, send messages, and create groups.

> Features:
* Add new users with details such as name, age, and gender.
* Make friendships between users.
* Send and view messages between users.
* Create and manage groups.

# Getting Started
> Prerequisites
* C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
* A code editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, CLion, etc.)

> Running the Projects
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-mini-projects.git
